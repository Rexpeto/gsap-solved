# GSAP Practical Guide

This project is a practical guide to learn and experiment with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), a JavaScript library for creating high-quality animations. We will learn to use various functions and features of GSAP, including `gsap.to()`, `gsap.from()`, `gsap.fromTo()`, `gsap Timeline`, `Staggers`, and `gsap ScrollTrigger`.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction to GSAP**

   - What is GSAP?
   - Installation and setup

2. **Basic Animations with `gsap.to()` and `gsap.from()`**

   - Creating simple animations
   - Using properties and durations

3. **Advanced Animations with `gsap.fromTo()`**

   - Complex transitions
   - Bounce and fade effects

4. **Using `gsap Timeline` for Animation Sequences**

   - Creating animation sequences
   - Controlling the sequence with `play()`, `pause()`, `reverse()`

5. **Consecutive Animations with `Staggers`**

   - Creating cascade effects
   - Adjusting delays between animations

6. **Integrating Animations with Scroll using `gsap ScrollTrigger`**

   - Scroll-based animations
   - Creating parallax effects

7. **Example Projects**
   - Practical animation examples
   - Challenges to apply what you've learned
